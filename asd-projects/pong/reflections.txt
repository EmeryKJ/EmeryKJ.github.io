////GAMEPLAY BASICS///
Two players each have control of one paddle. Each player's goal is to hit the ball 
and prevent it from hitting the wall behind their paddle while trying to make the ball hit the
wall behind the opponent.

A ball starts along the center line and heads in a diagonal line towards one of the sides.
If a player scores the ball resets and heads in the direction of the player who did not score.
Both players' paddles are vertically in the center of their side wall, slightly away from the wall.

A round ends when the ball hits the left or right wall and the opposite player gets a point. 
The game ends when one player has 5 points.

////VISUAL COMPONENTS/////
The board is a static background.         --> will need the dimensions of the background for the wall locations.

There is a static center dotted line.    --> will need the height of the line to randomly determine the ball's start.

There are two changing numbers on either side, top, that represent player scores. --> will need the score of each player.

There are two animated and user controlled rectangles on the left and right.
                                         --> will need the position of each paddle.
                                             will need the Y speed of each paddle.
                                             will need the height of each paddle to determine if the ball hits a paddle.
                                            
There is one animated ball that bounces. --> will need the posiition of the ball.
